  For the stickers though, I'll update as often as I can, which will probably be about once a week, anyways, how do you download it? Great Question, There is no one answer, but for this, you are going to need to sideload the app, either using Xcode, (If you have a mac) or if you have a PC, then you can use super impactor, which you can find <a href ="https://superimpactor.net/">here</a>, and you can also find Xcode <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">here</a>. If for some reason you can't use Xcode, or if you want to use a better way, then use altDeploy, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/pixelomer/AltDeploy/releases/download/v1.1/AltDeploy.zip">here</a>

In the past, there was an app called Cydia Impactor, but due to how apple treats sideloading, that app is no longer used, however, these newer methods will most likely be patched, because all the are using is the certificates that Xcode generates, however, you can learn more about it <a href="https://github.com/pixelomer/AltDeploy">here</a> created by Pixelomer. If you decide to use any of these methods, you have to refresh the app every 7 days. However, if you decide to go the jailbreaking route, then you can download a tweak to refresh the app every 7 days so it doesn't expire. </p>

Anyways, now, back to the stickers. They were made in Adobe Illustrator, and were imported into Xcode. This is probably the easiest thing that I've done in Xcode, and now I'm going to show you how you can make your own stickers
<Br><BR>
1. Design your stickers in an image editing program, whether it's Photoshop, Illustrator, or even Gimp or Microsoft Paint, as long as it's in a png format, then it will work
<br><br>
2. Save all of your pictures in an easily accessible folder
<br><br>
3. Open Xcode, and click on 
  -Create New Xcode Project
   -iMessage App
<br> <br>
4. Finally, click on the "Sticker Pack" folder, and drag your pictures into Xcode
<br> <br>
5. When you are all done, and you have your sticker pack how you want, you need to deploy it, so, if you have a device, follow these steps, if not, then skip to step --
<br> <br>
6. Plug in your iOS device
